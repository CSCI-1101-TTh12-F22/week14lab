# Week 10 Section Activities

## Part 1: Keyword and default arguments

Open `part1.py` , and follow the instructions in the comments.


## Part 2: `map()` and `lambda`
1. Create a list of 5 random integers between -10 and 10.

2. Write a for loop that creates a list containing the absolute value of those integers. Use the built-in `abs()` function.

3. Write a list comprehension that does the same thing, again using `abs()` function.

4. Use `map()` to do the same thing with `abs()`.

5. Use `map()` and `lambda` to do the same thing **without** `abs()`.

For more practice with `map()` and `lambda` do the same exercises as above with other functions:

* `pow()`
* `sqrt()` 
* `swapcase()` for strings


## Part 3: `zip()`

1. Create a list of the first names of people in the class.

2. Create a list of the favorite color of each person, in the same order.

3. Use a for loop with zip to print out "X's favorite color is Y" for each person and their color.
